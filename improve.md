  Current Algorithm Explanation

  The current string art algorithm is a greedy algorithm that works as follows:

  Core Logic: find_best_next_pin()

  1. Input: Current pin index, image array, constraints (minimum line spans, max pin usage)
  2. Candidate Selection:
    - Filters pins that meet constraints (not current pin, not last pin, within usage limit)
    - Samples only 30 candidates if more than 30 are available (for performance)
    - Applies minimum line span constraint (can't go to adjacent pins)
  3. Evaluation: For each candidate pin:
    - Uses calculate_line_darkness() to compute average darkness along the line
    - Uses Bresenham's line algorithm (via scikit-image) to get pixels along the line
    - Calculates average pixel value (lower = darker = better)
  4. Selection: Returns the darkest line that meets all constraints

  Image Update: update_image_array()

  - After choosing a line, "erases" the pixels along that line in the image array
  - Different strategies for edge pixels vs. non-edge pixels
  - Makes the algorithm focus on darker remaining areas in subsequent iterations

  Performance Characteristics

  - Sampling: Only evaluates 30 random candidates instead of all pins
  - Greedy: Always takes the locally optimal choice without considering future implications
  - Constraints: Enforces minimum line spans and maximum pin usage

  Improvement Ideas

  1. Better Candidate Selection

  Instead of random sampling, implement smarter sampling strategies:
  - Distance-based sampling: Prefer pins at certain distances (avoid too close/too far)
  - Directional bias: Favor directions that haven't been used recently
  - Adaptive sampling: Adjust sample size based on performance needs

  2. Lookahead Heuristics

  Replace pure greedy with limited lookahead:
  - 2-pin lookahead: Evaluate combinations of next two pins
  - Beam search: Keep top-k best partial sequences
  - Monte Carlo sampling: Try random sequences and pick best

  3. Improved Line Quality Metrics

  Instead of just average darkness, consider:
  - Weighted darkness: Give higher weight to center of line vs. ends
  - Line length normalization: Adjust for longer vs. shorter lines
  - Edge preservation: Prefer lines that follow detected edges better
  - Contrast enhancement: Prefer lines with high contrast at endpoints

  4. Global Optimization

  - Simulated annealing: Occasionally accept worse moves to escape local optima
  - Genetic algorithm: Evolve good pin sequences over generations
  - Reinforcement learning: Learn which pin choices lead to best overall results

  5. Performance Optimizations

  - Caching: Cache darkness calculations for common line patterns
  - Parallelization: Evaluate candidates in parallel
  - Early termination: Stop evaluation if a "good enough" line is found
  - Incremental darkness update: Instead of recalculating entire line

  6. Constraint-Based Improvements

  - Dynamic constraints: Adjust minimum spans based on progress
  - Usage-based penalties: Heavily penalize pins that approach usage limits
  - Progressive constraints: Start with fewer constraints, add more as completion nears

  7. Hybrid Approach

  - Initial coarse pass: Use larger sampling for rough outline
  - Refinement pass: Use smaller sampling for fine details
  - Multi-scale approach: Process image at different scales

  8. Machine Learning Enhancement

  - Pre-trained network: Use a network to predict good next pins
  - Feature extraction: Extract more sophisticated features from the image
  - Style transfer: Learn from existing string art examples

  Implementation Recommendation

  Start with these incremental improvements (easiest to implement, high impact):

  1. Replace random sampling with distance-based sampling:
    - Sample from pins at optimal distances (avoid too short/long lines)
    - This will improve line quality without major algorithm changes
  2. Add weighted darkness calculation:
    - Weight center pixels more heavily than edge pixels
    - This creates more natural-looking lines that follow contours better
  3. Implement 2-pin lookahead:
    - For each candidate, also consider the best option after that
    - This helps avoid local optima and creates more coherent patterns
  4. Add simulated annealing with temperature decay:
    - Start by accepting some worse moves, gradually become more selective
    - This helps escape local optima and find better global solutions

  These improvements maintain the core algorithm structure while significantly enhancing the quality of results.
