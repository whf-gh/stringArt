This document describe the communication protocol between PC program and Delta Robot.
In this system PC program act as a Server, and the Delta Robot act as a Client.
The purpose of communication is to transfer the array of coordinate from PC to Robot.
Each coordinate is a pair of REAL numbers represent the x,y coordinate of the position of a nail the Robot should route the string to.
All data transfer between Server and Client are encode and decode as ASCII string.

The Client send request to Server, the request is a number.
If the Client send "0" to Server, it will get the number of coordinate in the array, for example, there are 100 coordinate in array.
        Client---"0"--->Server
        Client<--"100"--Server
If the Client send a number bigger than 0, the Client will get relate count of coordinates from Server. 
        Client---"3"--->Server
        Client<--"(199.28800512565522, 132.74337861210535),(263.4792921248144, 948.3710135019719),(224.10737385376336, 113.49150281252633)"---Server
Each coordinate is surrended by Parentheses, and comma is use to seprate x,y inside a coordinate as well as coordinates inside the array.
Once a coordinate is sent to Client, it will be removed form the array.
If Server recived a request bigger than what is left in array, it will send all the left coordinates in array to Client.
